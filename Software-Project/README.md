# Software-Project

This is iteration 1. In this iteration, we have deployed a form from Django Frameworks. The server is running on Amazon EC2 instance and it is available on a publically accessible URL. The server is running, which accepts form submissions and on submission, it prints the form values on server. The server in reponse sends back next page to the client.
